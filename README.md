# Big-Data-Driven-Wildfire-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction
Demonstrated the potential of Machine Learning models for better understanding of vulnerabilities leading to disastrous wildfire events in California.

Datasets: Wildfire Data, Severity of Burns and Weather Data.
The data was collcected over a span of 4 years, from 2014 to 2017.

We applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Adaboost algorithms. \
We got highest frequency with Random Forest which was around 85%.

We observed that frequency of certain causes of wildfire was pretty high but the area burnt was not that severe.
On the other hand, certain causes such as Lightning, Arson were less frequent but the severity and area burnt due to them was high.
